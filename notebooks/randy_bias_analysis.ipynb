    "**First**, it sets up the file path to the folder where all the data is stored. The path points one level above the current folder into a directory called `datasets`. This helps keep the project organized and ensures anyone running the code can find the files, no matter where the script is located.\n",

    "**Next**, it loads three labeled datasets named `SG1`, `SG2`, and `MBIC`. These files contain sentences that have already been marked as either biased or non-biased. They use semicolons instead of commas to separate the data, which is why the `sep=';'` setting is used. These datasets are important because they give the model real examples of what biased and non-biased text looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then**, it reads in a file called `bias_word_lexicon.xlsx`, which is an Excel file containing a list of words commonly linked to bias. This list can be used to measure how many potentially biased words appear in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally**, it loads two more datasets: one containing biased news headlines and one containing neutral ones. These shorter texts can help the model recognize how bias appears even in small snippets of text.\n",
